## What is SQL?
<p>
    - SQL stands for Structured Query Language
    - SQL used CRUD operations to communicate with DB.
        1. CREATE - execute INSERT statements to insert new tuple into the relation.
        2. READ - Read data already in the relations.
        3. UPDATE - Modify already inserted data in the relation.
        4. DELETE - Delete specific data point/tuple/row or multiple rows.
    - ** SQL is not DB, is a query language. **
</p>

## what is Relational Database
<p>A relational database is a collection of data points with pre-defined relationships between them. The relational model organizes data into tables â€” with each row representing an individual record and each column consisting of attributes that contain values.</p>

## What is RDBMS and MYSQL?
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>(Relational Database Management System)</li>
    <li>The software used to store, manage, query, and retrieve data stored in a relational database is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). <B> The RDBMS provides an interface between users and applications and the database</B>, as well as administrative functions for managing data storage, access, and performance.</li>
    <li>e.g., MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, IBM etc.</li>
    <li>MySQL is open-source RDBMS, and it uses SQL for all CRUD operations</li>
    <li>MySQL used client-server model, where client is CLI or frontend that used services provided by MySQL server.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

## Difference between SQL and MySQL
> SQL is Structured Query language used to perform CRUD operations in R-DB, while MySQL is a RDBMS used to
> store, manage and administrate DB (provided by itself) using SQL.
